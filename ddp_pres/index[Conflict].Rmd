## Pathway analysis in disease genomics

+ Modern genomics studies obtain measurements for tens of thousands of
individual genes across dozens to hundreds of samples (patients, cells, etc.)  
+ Computational biologists apply statistics and machine learning to these 
large-scale "gene expression" datasets to aid in disease classification or 
diagnosis  
+ Something about pathway analysis...

## Quantifying pathway regulation with DIRAC

+ Differential Rank Conservation (DIRAC)**cite** is an approach I developed in my PhD 
to examine how within-pathway gene rankings change from sample-to-sample
+ For example, (pathway example with gene ranks)
+ Parts of the DIRAC method were recently published in the `GSReg` package in
Bioconductor
